The train has encountered a huge explosion and severely damaged when it just passed the Huanggutun station near Mukden. The Emperor is still alive according to the Kuantung Army, but they refuse to release more information about the Emperor's condition. This reminds us the Huanggutun incident in 1928, when Zhang Zuolin, who was the head-of-state of China and the father of the current chinese leader Zhang Xueliang, was assassinated."
